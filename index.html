    <div class="text-blurb">
      <p>Created by Lawrence Johnson and Coz Fiore, Pulse is a social media app designed to allow users to share music without 
        being limited by the streaming platform they use. This is achieved by Pulse interacting with both Spotify and Apple music 
        libraries. Currently, the next step of Pulse development is to get the mobile application into production on both the 
        Android and Apple app stores. On top of the existing project work, the MVP to get the application into production 
        includes, adding Apple music libraries to API searches and adding user ability to switch between Apple Music and Spotify, 
        as well as to delete their account. In addition to this, there are several goals beyond the MVP that the team would like 
        to achieve, such as push notifications, daily reminders to post music, and an algorithm to suggest profiles and posts to 
        keep users engaged with the app. There are several challenges surrounding getting this mobile app ready for production. 
        These challenges include, but are not limited to, the optimization and enhancement of existing cloud and API structures, 
        the implementation of notification, discovery, and subscription systems, and application publishing requirements.</p>
